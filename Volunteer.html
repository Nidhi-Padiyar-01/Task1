    <h1>Volunteer</h1>
    <p>Volunteers make an amazing difference in helping us run various programmes at Animal Care Trust. Are you interested in getting involved in animal rescues? Or going to schools and speakng with children about animals more your cup of tea? From rescues to humane education, from hands on work of bathing puppies and walking blind dogs at our shleter to bottle feeding kittens, from social media to setting up adoption camps, there is an activity for everyone who wants to get involved. </p>
