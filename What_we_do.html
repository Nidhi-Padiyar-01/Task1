    <h1>What We Do</h1>
    <p class="box"><b> Birth Control </b><br>
        Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme is recognized by the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) and statutorily governed by the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960 and Dog Rules 2001.

    <p class="box"><b> Rabies Vaccination</b><br>
        Rabies is an infectious disaease that puts both dogs and public at risk. Anti rabies vaccinations (ARV) play a critical role in helping curb this disease from spreading around in communities.
    </p>
    <p class="box"><b>Animal Adoptions</b><br>
        Sometimes puppies and kittens are rescued from the streets when a mother is not available or when the animals are too young to feed on their own. These animals are fostered by our volunteers at their homes until they are ready to be put up for adoption. Animal care Trust ensures that the animals put up for adoption are vaccinated, dewormed and are healthy
    </p>
    <p class="box"><b>Rescue Operations</b><br>
        Everyday, street animals are injured due to road accidents, inclement weather or human cruelty. Animals also fall sick, get viral fevers, get skin diseases or cancer. We receive on an average 100 rescue calls a week.
